<h2 type="section">IoT Sensors for Real-Time Monitoring</h2>
At the core of the smart waste management system are loT sensors installed in waste bins throughout the city. These sensors continuously monitor the fill levels of the bins, providing real-time data on the status of waste collection. By tracking the fill levels, the system can identify which bins are ready for collection, enabling more efficient routing and scheduling of waste collection vehicles.<br>

<h2 type="section" >GPS Tracking of Waste Collection Vehicles</h2>
<div>
    <p>In addition to the loT sensors in the waste bins, the system also utilizes GPS tracking on the waste collection vehicles. By monitoring the location and movements of these vehicles, the system can optimize the routes and schedules, ensuring that the waste is collected in the most efficient manner possible. This data can also be used to provide real-time updates to citizens on the status of waste collection in their neighborhoods.</p>
</div>

<section id="slide-4">
<h2 type="section">Data Analytics for Optimization</h2>
<div>The data collected from the loT sensors and GPS tracking is fed into a comprehensive data analytics platform. This platform uses advanced algorithms to identify patterns, trends, and insights that can be used to optimize the waste management process. By analyzing factors such as waste generation rates, collection schedules, and vehicle utilization, the system can make recommendations for improving efficiency, reducing costs, and minimizing the environmental impact of waste management.<br></div>
